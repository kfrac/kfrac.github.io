## About me

I am a geographer interested in topics related to climate, conservation and transportation. For my work with spatial data, I use `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")` as well as traditional GIS. In my master's thesis, I modelled where and when Lidar can effectively measure wind speed in Germany based on satellite observations of aerosols. I am currently seeking employment.
