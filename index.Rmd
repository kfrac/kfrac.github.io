## About me

I am a geographer interested in climate, conservation and transportation topics. I use R and GIS. In my master's thesis, I modelled where and when Lidar can effectively measure wind speed in Germany based on satellite observations of aerosols. I also freelance edit journal articles. I am currently seeking employment. `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")`
